Python RPN Calculator
=====================

This is an RPN calculator in Python.
You give it instructions as command line arguments.
It works with rationals and has some other strange features
that I decided I wanted.

Fictitiously Asked Questions
----------------------------

Why make an RPN calculator in Python?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* I like RPN
* The Python REPL doesn't work with fraction literals
* The `dc` application doesn't work with rationals
* It isn't very difficult

Isn't `:` being used as an infix operator?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.  You're confusing it with
the `:` used as part of rational literals.
I wouldn't make the novice mistake of
mixing infix and postfix operators.

Aren't negative numbers displayed inconsistently?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Okay, you've got me there
